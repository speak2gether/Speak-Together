# Speak-Together
project Idea:-

Speak 2 Gather is a digital platform that supports children with ADHD by helping families connect with specialized doctors and access structured guidance in a calm, organized way.
The platform empowers parents to track their child’s progress, receive expert tips, explore helpful blogs, join events, and interact with a supportive community.

It also includes a simple Kids Area with ADHD-friendly games that encourage emotional expression and focus-building activities.

Through a combination of specialist support, parent tools, and child-centered activities, Speak 2 Gather creates a clear, warm, and reliable experience that helps families understand and support their children better.
